# Car Rental System

## Getting started
This is a car rental system that implements domain-driven design (DDD) and clean architecture principles. The solution includes various layers like Domain, Application, and Persistence. There is no presentation layer or startup project in this solution. To validate the business logic, you can run the integration test.ðŸš€

### Noba.CarRental.IntegrationTest
To run the business logic test you need to run the `Noba.CarRental.IntegrationTest` project.
- TestMethod: `CompleteCarRentalFlow_PickupAndReturn_Success`
- Test Type: Integration Test

This test simulates the full rental flow: picking up a car and returning it. It uses inline data which you can modify to test different scenarios.

## Prerequisites
Install the following prerequisites:

- **[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)**
  If you have .NET installed, use the dotnet --info command to determine which SDK you're using.
